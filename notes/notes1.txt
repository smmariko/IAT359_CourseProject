styles are (text, (optional) shadow, color)

Summary of updates for front-end-2

INSTALL NEW DEPENDENCIES (copy and paste below)
run npx expo install expo-font

Moved LoginScreen and SignUpScreen onto separate pages in the newly created screens folder
For navgiation, deleted useNavigation and instead passed it as a parameter
Ex. const function HomeScreen ({navigation, route})
you need navigation if you want to navigate to another page, and route if you want to go back
See lecture for more details

    Not done yet separating styles for pages

    From now on, create pages on separate screens within the screens folder for ease of access

Created components in the components folder
Basically a folder where I'm taking everything on the Figma files (atoms, molecules etc)
and replicating them in code. Certain things that don't exist in the app aren't coded

    styles are basic colors and fonts
    button is mroe the primary and secondary buttons that exist in the app
    formField is form fields and searchField

    for instruction on use, it is commented in those files

    icons not yet loaded, will probably create a folder inside icons for them

Added responsive scaling to UI elements
This is in dimensions, basically there's two functions that
scale the height and width of things based of the screen size

    Use this on any UI elements placed on the screen

    READ comments in dimensionScaling for important info

Added custom fonts
Lmk if they don't work for you. You shouldn't have to do anything though, except download

For further code, lmk if we have a database that I can hook up to the cards
and a bare bones structure is good for me for any new stuff
